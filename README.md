# 💫 About Me:
I’m a senior undergraduate Geology student with a passion for Geophysics—especially Seismology and Hydrogeophysics—and Computational Science. Lately, I’ve been exploring AI-driven forecasting, and I also enjoy working with image processing techniques for clustering and classification.<br>

Beyond academics, I love developing open-source software, where I can blend problem-solving with creativity. I’m an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys hiking, learning about different cultures, and connecting with people. Music and video games are also a big part of my life, offering both inspiration and relaxation.<br>

I have a deep appreciation for fine pens—my favorite being the Cross ATX and Parker 105—and watches, recently adding a mint green Tissot PRX to my collection. In my free time, I play the Kamancheh, inspired by the artistry of Ali-Asghar Bahari. <br>
🏬 Current Role: R&D Specialist at FEZtool <br>🤝 Looking For: Graduate positions in Earth Science<br>📖 Education: Studying Geology at KhU, developing ML models and numerical solutions in geoscience<br>
